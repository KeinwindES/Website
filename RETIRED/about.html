        <h2>History of Keinwind EichenSchwert</h2>
        <p>
            I was born on December 20th, 2005, in Bergen. I started playing games for god knows long. <br>
            I attended kindergarten for 5 years, elementary school for 7 years, middle school for 3 years, and then high schoolâ€”ITM for the first year and IT for the second year. <br>
            My interest in coding began after watching a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Danidev">Dani</a>, inspired me to do something similar. <br>
            I spent 1 year at ITM and 1 year at IT.
        </p>

            On November 4th, I began learning German. I used Duolingo for a month, then switched to other methods like LingoDeer and flashcards both did not go so well so switched back to Duo. <br>
            LingoDeer was problematic, and I didn't want to pay for it. Flashcards were also inconvenient, so I stopped. I might pick it up again. <br>
            I am fluent in Norwegian and English and currently learning German. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            i am currently studying Programing at Stavanger. and it only a 10 minute walk to the closes store. Luckly the dorms are in the same building as the classroom <br>
            I am learning HTML, CSS, and JS, but ill try out Python during my free time becouse i love to push weak programing languages to the limits <br>
            and i am sharing a dorm with a classmate hes a cool guy, he is into anime like me, and we plan on byuing a projector for watching anime in the dorm on big screen<br>
